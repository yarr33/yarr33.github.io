        did you know that one of the best ways to
        start a friend ship or have fun when you
        and your friends are bored is dicussing things?
        yes, that's philosophy. but you won't always
        find a subject to talk about.<br></br>
        this page has a lot of subjects to talk about
        and deeply discuss with hints how to continue
        the conversation. have fun geeking out with your
        friends!<br></br>
        still on beta - there are not much of topics to discuss about.
