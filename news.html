               add more new things to this site. I will update the news here almost every week, it will be about new features if this site, or just blogs about my projects.
               If you don't know me IRL, or by any other social media expect github, that's cool. Somehow you found me, haha.<br><br>
               You might need more explanation about this site, how and why I created it. It all started when I read Cucumber Quest, the amazing webcomic by gigidigi. I've
               heard about other ones as well, and then I've got inspiration for my own comic. I thought to myself, for a webcomic, you need a site. Then I thought that
               I can share my projects and create html apps everyone can acess. I have this small site now. And yeah, I'm still thinking about creating that webcomic.`],

              use them. I've got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/truttle1">truttle1</a> in my recommendations in youtube, and watched his entire Esolabyrinth series, where
              every episode he picks an esolang and programs something cool with it. I recommend watching it because it's cool. In the first episode, he made a battle
              system in brainf**k. So, I've decided that I'll challange myself coding an "entire" RPG. once I'll done coding it, I will create a new page in the site for it.`],

             learn python. yeah, python is my favourite programming language I commonly use. Guess what? I found a lot of python programs I wrote a long time ago. And the best part is that I will upload them to github.
             I won't upload a program that does not work properly, so I will fix some of them. If you code in python, keep in mind, I'm coding a lot better than back then. If you see a ton of globals

             Anyways. recently I uploaded only one of these programs. It picks a random music file from your computer and plays it. Then again. And again. I remember that I used to code
             while it was running in the background. Sadly, I don't have a lot of music files on my computer. Maybe some of you do. If you want to use it download the code <a href="https://github.com/yarr33/good-ol-codes/blob/main/randomMusic.py">here</a>

             be running in the console! (Well, there are several types of displays. displaying the game in the console will cause unwanted text movements because of autoscrolling.) However, I've decided to take a break and test the features I've already implemented,
