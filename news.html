  news = [["Hello and Welcome to news!","27/5/2021",`I know not much of people know this site/interested in this site but I work on it as a hobby. However, I will
           add more new things to this site. I will update the news here almost every week, it will be about new features if this site, or just blogs about my projects.
           If you don't know me IRL, or by any other social media expect github, that's cool. Somehow you found me, haha.<br><br>
           You might need more explanation about this site, how and why I created it. It all started when I read Cucumber Quest, the amazing webcomic by gigidigi. I've
           heard about other ones as well, and then I've got inspiration for my own comic. I thought to myself, for a webcomic, you need a site. Then I thought that
           I can share my projects and create html apps everyone can acess. I have this small site now. And yeah, I'm still thinking about creating that webcomic.`],
          ["I HAVE DECIDED I'M MAKING AN TEXT BASED RPG USING BRAINF**K","28/5/2021",`Esolangs are pretty cool. Well they melt my brain but it's still fun to
          use them. I've got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/truttle1">truttle1</a> in my recommendations in youtube, and watched his entire Esolabyrinth series, where
          every episode he picks an esolang and programs something cool with it. I recommend watching it because it's cool. In the first episode, he made a battle
          system in brainf**k. So, I've decided that I'll challange myself coding an "entire" RPG. once I'll done coding it, I will create a new page in the site for it.`],
         ["Tic Tac Toe 3d","8/6/2021",`just had a random idea to make tic tac toe 3d, where you place X's or O's inside a cube built of more cubes... however,
         there's a ton of ways to win. unfortunately... the one who started playing is the one who won. that's my fault. if you want to play it its here: <a href="https://yarr33.github.io/ttt3d">here</a> `],
         ["A lot of new things coming to this site!","17/6/2021",`The summer is here, that means I have a lot of free time. I will add a lot of stuff to my site.
         A new small and sick word game will be added soon, and a major update for the dicussiongen will land. It will have a lot more things to talk about. Well that's all
         I have planned for now, stay tuned for more new things here!`],
         ["News now have rss!","10/7/2021",`I just added RSS for news, and you will be able to follow and get notified of any new news here! To get notified, use 
         an RSS reader. You might want to get notifications on your mobile phone, so you can use Pluma RSS Reader, an app for android. You can also use Feeder, a chrome extension
         (that works on any browser based on the chromium API) <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp">get it here</a><br>
         Then, add the RSS url <b>https://github.com/yarr33/yarr33.github.io/commits/main/news.html.atom</b> and that's it. (NOTE: Because of me being dumb, clicking on the 
         notification will lead to the github commit. instead just open the news page!)`],
         ["I found my old programs!","16/7/2021",`I'm programming for a long time already (tbh I don't know if almost 4 years is a long time). Started with C#/arduino, went through brainf**k and then decided to 
         learn python. yeah, python is my favourite programming language I commonly use. Guess what? I found a lot of python programs I wrote a long time ago. And the best part is that I will upload them to github.
         I won't upload a program that does not work properly, so I will fix some of them. If you code in python, keep in mind, I'm coding a lot better than back then. If you see a ton of globals
         and very <b>very</b> dumb algorithms - please forgive my past self. <br><br>
         Anyways. recently I uploaded only one of these programs. It picks a random music file from your computer and plays it. Then again. And again. I remember that I used to code
         while it was running in the background. Sadly, I don't have a lot of music files on my computer. Maybe some of you do. If you want to use it download the code <a href="https://github.com/yarr33/good-ol-codes/blob/main/randomMusic.py">here</a>
         and make sure you have pygame installed. If you don't, to get pygame enter <b>py -m pip install pygame</b> in cmd on windows, or enter <b>sudo apt-get install python-pygame</b> in the terminal on linux (I'm not sure, I'm not
         a linux user, but I'm probably going to be (; )<br><br>While writing this post, a random music file is playing in the background...`]]
