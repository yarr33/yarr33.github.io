            Geoguessr is a very nice game where you have to guess the coordinates of a place by looking at an image from it's coordinates. you<br>
            can play it <a href="https://geoguessr.com">here</a>. Anyways... there are many limitations. One major limitation, is that you can play only one time per day. To bypass<br>
            them, you have to pay money. Instead of paying money, you can play my version. What's better here is that there are unlimited<br>
            places, unlike in the original geoguessr. My version is completely free, and has configurable options! 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h>how to play?</h>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            first of all, you can set setting for your game. settings are explained <a href="#settings">here.</a> after you set the settings, click play. there is a street view,
            <br>a bar at the bottom and a map at the top left corner. in the bar there's information about the round, the score, the time remaining (if specified)<br>
            and an option to save the location. after saving, the location will appear with a star (â˜†) at the end of the game. you can rotate the street view, zoom and in some<br>
            locations you will be able to move too. to choose your location, hover you mouse on the map and click a place. to guess it, click 'guess'. if you want the map<br>
            to stay extended, click the lock button that will appear on the map at its extended mode. if you're stuck, click the 'skip' button in the right side of the bottom bar.
            <br>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">after you've guessed, a screen will appear. the distance between your guess and the chosen location will be written and explained in a map.<br>
        also there's info about the round and the guess. after you've done reading, or you want to go to the next round, simply click 'next'. at the end of the game, a table will appear<br>
        with statistics and information about every round, and the round where you saved the location, will appear a star as mentioned before. you can view the panorama again<br>
        by clicking the link at the rightmost table column. click 'play again' to.. play again.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="settings" style="text-align: left;">
        the settings allow you to customize your game. you can change the points, the distance and the guessing. in the first field, you can change how scoring will work.<br>
        maximum points, is the maximum score you will get when you are hyperexact. minimum points is the score that you will get when you miss/not close at all.<br>
        skip cost, is how many points you will have to pay after every skip. now, the guessing field changes the guessing. there are two guessing types: dynamic and static.<br>
        when the dynamic guessing is enabled, the player has to guess the position of where he's in the street view, even after he moves. with the static guessing,<br>
        the player has to guess the initial position of the street view when the round has begun. with time limit, you can change the time limit for every guess. 5 minutes<br>
        is the maximum. maximum distance to gain points, is the maximum distance between the player's guess and the chosen location where the player will be able to gain<br>
        points greater than the minimum. and the rounds, is how many rounds will be in the game. note that some values have limits, if you bypass the limit the game will<br>
        automatically fix them.</p>
